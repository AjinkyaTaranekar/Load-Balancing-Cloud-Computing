Following Algorithms have been implemented :

* FCFS considers arrival time of tasks which means task which arrives first will be executed first. It is non-preemptive in nature. Although it is not a complex algorithm but in some cases it leads to inefficiency. For instance if a longer task arrives first then the shorter task which arrives later will have to wait for its execution, increasing the waiting time of shorter tasks.
